This is the Data Science and Statistical Programming Applied to Agriculture course taught by Dr. Bastos in the spring of 2025.

#Course learning outcomes
The general course objective is to provide students with hands-on applied experience in analyzing
agricultural data using modern reproducible tools. That involves: - Learning and applying analytical
workflows that involve importing data, processing, analyzing, assessing model fit, extracting model
information (means and pairwise comparisons, regression coefficients) and producing publication-
ready figures for different analysis including ANOVAs and regression. - Conducting analysis of
variance workflows for the most commonly used agricultural designed studies (completely
randomized design, randomized complete block design, split-plot design) - Conducting linear and
non-linear regression workflows. - Learning and applying machine learning concepts (bias-variance
trade-off, data split, hyper-parameter optimization, predictive metrics) and algorithms to
agricultural observational data (soils, weather, yield). - Doing all the above while learning and using
data science tools for reproducibility like version control, statistical programming, APIs to publicly
available data sets, task automation, and creating online interactive dashboards.
